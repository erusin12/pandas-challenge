Week 4 Homework
This challenge had us reviewing school data to perform an analysis to assist with budget decisions.  We were provided two datasets in CSV files which were opened and merged in Jupyter Notebook.  We were provided a starter code and some guidelines in the comments to create the code.

The two data sets were merged and a District Summary was created with an overall budget, number of students, and average scores.

The data was then grouped by the 15 individual High Schools to show the type of school, budget, number of students, and scores.

Next the scores by grade were reviewed as well as the spending per school.

Lastly, the data was grouped by size and by type.

Creating these groups and filters for the data allowed me to write up an analysis, which is written at the top.

I encountered on multiple occasions instances where the code would work, and then give errors another time.  I often had to clearly define variables.  I had assistance from the internet with errors as well as a study group.
